Works best when searching for a single word. For example, the difference in the results for "tilraun" (test)

All word forms:
http://leitarordid.geirfreysson.com/search/?q=tilraun&btnG=Leita&lr=ordmyndir

Without all word forms:
http://leitarordid.geirfreysson.com/search/?q=tilraun&btnG=Leita&lr=plain

== Setup

The database uses the "Sigrúnarsnið" database (http://ordid.is/gogn) but in order to make it work with the Rails app, the following line is appended to the sql dump (I recommend using vim, it's a large file):

ALTER TABLE bin ADD id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT FIRST, ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
